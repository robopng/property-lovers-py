    A controller for dialog files intended for use in the dating sim.
    Dating sim dialog files are in a special json format:
      - A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a line
      - On an NPC dialog line, each dictionary has three keys: text, from, next
      - On a player dialog line, text is replaced with options, a list of three dictionaries
        in the form {"Option 1": 1, "Option 2", 2}
      - Key 'from' in the first line will always be 'start', and key 'next' in the last will
        always be 'end'
      - On a player line, key 'next' will always be 'jump', and the 3 options following will
        have key 'from' be 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the values in the 'options' list
